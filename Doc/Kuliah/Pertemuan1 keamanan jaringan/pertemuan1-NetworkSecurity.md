OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an ideal concept of how the interconnection of networks is done in order to interconnect. Why is there a layer? Due to the ease in learning. So maybe we can not directly read a bit without being &quot;wrapped&quot;. So the &quot;parcel&quot; bit was called layer. This is the most ideal connection, was so difficult ideally to be implemented in the real world. So OSI Layer is an ideal interconnection conditions that are difficult to be implemented in the real world. We use now instead of the OSI, the layer that we use now is TCP / IP. TCP / IP is the condition at this time when we are connected to the world via the internet. OSI has a complete layer, namely:

Physical Layer (1st Layer)

Data Link Layer (2nd Layer)

Network Layer (3th Layer)

Transport Layer (4th Layer)

Session Layer (5th Layer)

Presentation Layer (6th Layer)

Application Layer (7th Layer)

While TCP / IP has four layers, namely:

Application

Transport (TCP/IP)

Internet (IP)

Network Acces Layer (eth)

1. The example of Application is that we use as a browser, http, gmail, etc.

2. Transport  (TCP / UDP) . TCP and UDP difference is if TCP must complete their data, for example, that if the data transmitted until 10 then that should also be 10. Its function is to check the data that was taken. If UDP is not complete, for example, if we transmit data 10 then only 6 are up there. Why? Due to this for the benefit of a functional application. If using UDP, the application is downloaded will be failed. Examples of applications that use UDP is an application for video calls, Skype, Youtube (Youtube streaming using UDP, and website using TCP).

3. IP (Internet Protocol) is how to communicate between network. Basically the computer is connected to another computer in one room of a single subnet. The subnet is class or limit / number of computers. For example: 192.168.1.0/24

Information:

192 = Class A, 1 block = 8 bits

168 = class b, 1 block = 8 bits

1 = Class C, 1 block = 8 bits

0/24 d = class (because there are three blocks, so 8 bits x 3 = 24)

In one subnet to communicate via the Mac Address, the subnet are broadcast from the Mac Address.
